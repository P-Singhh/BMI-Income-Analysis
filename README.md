# BMI and Income Inequality: An Analytical Study

**Project Overview**

---

**Dataset**
- **Source**: [Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/)
- **Collected by**: University of Michigan  
- **Years**: 2020–2021  
- **Sample Size**: ~5,000 individuals  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - BMI  
  - Income  
  - Age  
  - Gender  
  - Employment status  
  - Education level

 --- 
 
**Methodology**
- Controlled for demographic factors (age, gender, employment, education)
- Examined both **linear** and **non-linear** (logarithmic, quadratic) relationships
- Focused on threshold effects in wage trends across different BMI ranges
- Employed statistical modeling and visual analysis

---

**Key Findings**
- Individuals with a **BMI below 30** generally earned more than those above this threshold.
- **Non-linear effects** were observed: slight wage increases occurred at lower BMI levels, but **wages plateaued and declined** at higher BMI levels.
- This suggests a **diminishing return** in wages as BMI increases, indicating potential thresholds of bias or economic penalties.

---

**Interpretation**
- While some prior studies suggest a strict wage penalty for higher BMI, this study reveals a more **complex relationship** — showing modest wage gains at certain BMI ranges before diminishing returns set in.
- Findings align in part with prior literature (Mukhopadhyay, 2021; Inafuku, 2023), but suggest additional nuance, particularly regarding bias, industry context, and intersectionality.

---

**Limitations**
- Lacks control for **unobservable traits** (e.g., health behavior, personality)
- No breakdown by **industry or job type**, which could moderate the relationship
- Cross-sectional nature limits **causal conclusions**
- Future work should adopt **longitudinal** or **quasi-experimental** methods
